Project
Introduction
This repository contains a data science project focused on analyzing and predicting forest fires in Algeria. Forest fires pose a significant threat to both the environment and public safety, and this project aims to leverage data science techniques to better understand and mitigate these risks.

Project Overview
Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the occurrence and severity of forest fires in Algeria. By analyzing historical data and environmental factors, we aim to provide valuable insights for forest fire prevention and management.

Data
The project uses a dataset of historical forest fire records in Algeria, which includes information such as location, date, weather conditions, and fire severity. The dataset is available in the data directory and is named algerian_forest_fires.csv.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and formatting issues. Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data.

Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that can help in predicting forest fires, such as weather variables, vegetation indices, and historical fire data.

Model Building: Develop machine learning models for predicting forest fires. Experiment with various algorithms, including but not limited to logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Employ cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness.

Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate key findings, including geographical distribution of fires, seasonal trends, and feature importance.

Deployment (Optional): If applicable, deploy the predictive model as a web application or API for real-time fire risk assessment.
